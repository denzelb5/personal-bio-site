        As a professional violinist with a career spanning over 25 years, 
        I know what itâ€™s like to have the passion to follow your dreams, 
        combined with the discipline to make that dream a reality.  
        A member of the Nashville Symphony, in my 24th season, 
        I have performed throughout the United States and Europe, 
        played in Carnegie Hall, and participated in over 14 Grammy 
        award winning recordings.

      I am drawn to writing software for many of the same reasons 
      I am drawn to music. The creative process of bringing ideas to 
      life, the constant necessity to always keep learning, and the 
      puzzle aspect of trouble shooting and problem solving.
